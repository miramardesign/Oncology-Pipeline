                            <li>M8891* is an investigational, small-molecule designed as a reversible, orally <br>bioavailable inhibitor of Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2). This molecule is <br>currently under clinical investigation and has not been proven to
                                be safe and effective</li>
                            <li>MetAP2 is an enzyme that is important for angiogenesis and proliferation in several<br> tumor types; it therefore serves as a relevant therapeutic target for anti-cancer <br>treatment development</li>
